GAME RULES

Monopoly Deal is a four-player, simplified card game version of the board game Monopoly.

Equipment:

Monopoly Deal is played with a deck of cards. The deck contains three different categories of cards. The first is a money card,
which represents a monetary amount only. The second is a property card. These cards are named and color coded to match properties
of the same group. The final category of card is action cards. Action cards tell the user what to do when that card is played.
Each card in the deck also has a monetary value associated with it, regardless of whether or not it is strictly a money card.

Game Play:
To play the game, each player is initially dealt 5 cards. Each player can look at his or her own cards, but cannot see the cards
of the other players. After dealing the initial cards, the remaining cards in the deck are placed facedown in the middle of the
table as a draw pile.

The player to the left of the dealer plays first, and game play continues in a clockwise fashion until someone wins. To begin each
turn, a player draws two cards from the pile in the middle (if a player starts their turn with an empty hand, they will draw five
cards instead). The player then plays up to three cards from their hand (they may play none). Three actions can be taken when
playing a card:

1. Adding money to your bank. A player can add a card to their bank by placing it in their money pile, which lies face up in front
of them. Players can add both money cards and action cards to their bank. If the card added to their bank is an action card, it
becomes worth its monetary value and can no longer be used as an action card. The money from the bank is used to pay other players
throughout the game, as necessary. You cannot pay another player with money from your hand.

2. Add a property card to your property collection. This is done by placing the card face up in front of you. The object of the game
is to collect 3 complete property sets. Property sets are grouped by color.

3. Play an action card. This is done by placing the card into the discard pile, and doing whatever action is written on the card.

Game Objective:
The goal of the game is to be the first player to collect three property sets. When someone has collected three property sets, the
game ends and that player wins.
